You are an experienced QA engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software development project. Analyze the following information about the project:

<project_code>

</project_code>

<technology_stack>
[tech-stack.md](mdc:.ai/tech-stack.md)
</technology_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan that will be tailored to the specifics of the project, taking into account the technologies used, the code structure, and the key elements of the repository. The test plan should be written in Polish.

Before creating the test plan, conduct an in-depth analysis of the project inside the <project_analysis> block in your mind map. Include the following in your analysis:

1. Key project components resulting from code analysis:
   - List and describe the main components of the project
2. The specifics of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:
   - Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing
3. Testing priorities based on the repository structure:
   - Identify and rank test areas by importance
4. Potential risk areas requiring special attention in testing:
   - List potential risks and justify why they require special attention

After completing the analysis, create a test plan inside the <test_plan> block. The plan should include:

1. Introduction and testing objectives
2. Scope of testing
3. Types of tests to be performed (e.g., unit, integration, performance tests)
4. Test scenarios for key functionalities
5. Test environment
6. Testing tools
7. Test schedule
8. Test acceptance criteria
9. Roles and responsibilities in the testing process
10. Bug reporting procedures

Remember that the test plan should be:
- Precisely tailored to the context of the project
- Take into account the specifics of the technologies used
- Prioritize key elements of the repository
- Written in Polish
- Present high quality and professionalism

Start with analysis, then move on to creating a test plan. Your final result should consist only of the test plan and should not duplicate or summarize any work done in the project analysis block.

Present this plan in Markdown format.
